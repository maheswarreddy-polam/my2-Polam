### Glacier National Park

Glaciers are the main draw of this Montana national park, but its more than 700 lakes, **two mountain ranges** and **multiple waterfalls** are equally impressive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### This is the ordered list of my favourite spot.

1) Backcountry Camping. With its towering mountains, pristine alpine lakes, abundant wildlife, and over 700 miles of trails, Glacier is a  backpacking paradise.

2) Outdoor Activities

3) Cultural & Theme Tours
